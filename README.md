# VAA Workshop Bonus Materials üéØ

**Bonus Code delivered as promised from the VAA Claude Code & RAG Systems Workshop**

This repository contains the complete bonus materials promised during the VAA workshop: powerful tools to enhance your Claude Code workflow with conversation parsing and real-time status monitoring.

## üì¶ What's Inside

### üîß Claude Conversation Parser V2
Transform your Claude Code conversations from cryptic JSONL files into beautifully formatted, human-readable Markdown documents.

**Key Features:**
- **SpecStory Compatible**: Perfect integration with existing Cursor workflows
- **Smart Filtering**: Removes noise and maintains meaningful conversation flow  
- **Intelligent Naming**: Maps UUID filenames to descriptive conversation titles
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Python, no external libraries required
- **Batch Processing**: Handle single files or entire directories

### üìä Claude Code Status Line
Get real-time insights into your Claude Code sessions with comprehensive metrics and performance monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor input/output tokens and cache efficiency
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time cost calculation and savings from caching
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, token generation speed, error rates
- **Git Integration**: Current branch and repository context
- **Session Depth**: Track conversation length to prevent context issues

### üìö Custom Slash Commands Guide
Complete guide for creating powerful custom Claude Code commands with advanced argument handling.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Parser Usage
```bash
# Convert a single conversation
python Bonus_Code/Parser/claude_parser_v2.py ~/.claude/projects/my-project/conversation.jsonl

# Process all conversations in a project
python Bonus_Code/Parser/claude_parser_v2.py ~/.claude/projects/my-project/

# Custom output location
python Bonus_Code/Parser/claude_parser_v2.py conversation.jsonl -o /custom/output/
```

### Status Line Usage  
```bash
# Run the status line (integrate with your shell prompt)
python Bonus_Code/Status_Line/main_status_line.py
```

## üìñ Complete Documentation

Each tool comes with comprehensive documentation:

- **[Parser Guide](Bonus_Code/Parser/PARSER_GUIDE.md)** - Complete installation, usage, and troubleshooting guide
- **[Status Line Research](Bonus_Code/Status_Line/Status_Line_Research_ENG.md)** - Deep dive into Claude Code transcripts and implementation details
- **[Custom Commands Guide](Bonus_Code/Custom_Slash_Commands_Guide.md)** - Master advanced slash command creation

## üß† Part of Something Bigger: ChatTokener

These tools are components of **ChatTokener**, a comprehensive suite for AI conversation management currently under active development.

### What is ChatTokener?

ChatTokener transforms the chaos of AI conversations into your permanent technical memory:

- **üîç Intelligent Conversation Visualization** - Turn-by-turn summaries with micro-titles
- **üìä Advanced Analytics** - Token usage, cost optimization, and performance metrics  
- **üï∏Ô∏è RAG System Integration** - LightRAG + Graphiti knowledge graphs with Neo4j
- **üíæ Permanent Technical Memory** - Never lose valuable problem-solving conversations again

> **50-70% compression ratio** achieved while maintaining full detail through intelligent turn-by-turn summarization.

### Early Access

Want early access to the complete ChatTokener Suite? Send an email with subject "**ChatTokener**" to: **vibecoding@pcok.it**

## ‚ö° Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **No external dependencies** for the parser
- **Read access** to Claude Code conversation files (`~/.claude/projects/`)
- **Write access** for output directories

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Navigate** to the Bonus_Code directory
3. **Run the tools** directly with Python - no installation required!

```bash
# No pip install needed - pure Python tools
python Bonus_Code/Parser/claude_parser_v2.py --help
python Bonus_Code/Status_Line/main_status_line.py
```

## üîó Integration with Existing Workflows

### SpecStory Compatibility
The parser generates **identical** output to the SpecStory Cursor extension, allowing seamless switching between:
- Cursor + SpecStory ‚Üí **Automatic conversation capture**  
- Claude Code + This Parser ‚Üí **Same format, same location**

All conversations end up in `.specstory/history/` with identical markdown structure.

### Claude Code Integration
The status line integrates directly with Claude Code through the settings configuration:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "python /path/to/Bonus_Code/Status_Line/main_status_line.py",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

Add this configuration to your `.claude/settings.json` file, or use the `/statusline` command in Claude Code for interactive setup.

## üéØ Use Cases

### For the Parser
- **Maintain conversation history** when switching from Cursor to Claude Code
- **Create readable documentation** from AI-assisted development sessions
- **Archive important problem-solving conversations** in searchable format
- **Share AI conversations** with team members in readable form

### For the Status Line  
- **Monitor token usage** to optimize context management
- **Track costs** across different models and sessions
- **Identify performance bottlenecks** in tool usage
- **Prevent context loss** by monitoring session depth

## ü§ù Support & Community

For questions, issues, or contributions:
- **Read the comprehensive guides** included with each tool
- **Test with sample files** before processing important conversations  
- **Check existing patterns** in the filtering logic for customization
